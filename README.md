# Hazards Endeavors
An interactive and non-interactive source of information about hazards.

_Hazards Endeavors_ is dedicated to the public domain, for everyone to be able to freely inspect and improve on.

## Purpose
The site provides knowledge in two ways:
- Interactive, point-and-click, decision making games. Based on the choice of the user, different situations and endings will appear. The user may then share the result to others.
- Traditional text-based articles. The user may also take a quiz to test their knowledge.

## More information
The website was created to compete in the Science and Engineering competition (and achieved 7th place overall out of 195 projects). The original intention was fire-related games, but more ideas were added during the discussion. The development is halted, as the competition is over.

This is the first project of the authors, so the organisation may not be the greatest. Regardless, the experience provided is invaluable.
