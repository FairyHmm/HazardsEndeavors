# Fairy
Do I exist? Alas, us fairies are merely figments of your imagination, a captivating creation of your own design. Wake up before the hourglass empties, for the essence of reality escapes you.

I can be whatever and whoever you desire.

Let it go, let it go. Can't hold it back anymore. Let it go, let it go. Turn away and slam the door!
