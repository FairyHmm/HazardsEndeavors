# Flood

_Flood_ occurs when water overflows onto land that is typically dry. This can happen when rivers, lakes, or oceans overflow, or when rainwater accumulates on saturated ground.

Flood is studied and is important in agriculture, civil engineering, and public health.

## Causes

Heavy and prolonged rainfall (due to large storms) is the main cause of floods. In addition, in the delta region, specifically at river mouths adjacent to the sea, high tides are a factor that exacerbates flooding.

In addition, there are other factors that affect the occurrence of large and unusual floods. The wider the area, the slower the floodwater rises and recedes, whereas if the watershed is narrow and elongated, the floodwater will rise faster. In some cases, flash floods and mudslides can even occur.

Human activities, like deforestation and changes to waterways, can make flooding more frequent and intense. Climate change also contributes to the severity of floods by increasing rainfall and extreme weather events.

## Common types of flood

- **River flood**: May occur when there is prolonged rainfall, causing water to overflow into riverside areas.
- **Slow flood**: May occur due to prolonged rainfall (commonly seen in tropical regions) or rapid snowmelt (commonly in cold regions), causing the water volume to exceed the capacity of canals or rivers. Heavy rain, storms, and tropical depressions are also other causes of slow-onset floods.
- **Flash flood**: Usually caused by strong storms.
- **Coastal flood**: Due to violent sea storms or other disasters such as tsunamis.
- **Floods caused by disasters**: Various causes, such as dam breaks, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc.
- **Floods caused by humans**: Could be due to broken canals and pinelines.

## Impacts

### Immediate impacts

- **Water scarcity and related issues**: Water becomes polluted due to waste from sewage systems, drains, and overflowing lakes and ponds onto streets, houses, and public water supply areas. This pollution leads to a shortage of clean water for drinking and other purposes.
- **Diseases in humans and animals**: Poor hygiene and waterborne diseases are common consequences of water pollution. In this scenario, epidemic diseases can easily emerge and spread, as waterborne diseases tend to spread more rapidly through water than through the air. Cholera is one example of such a disease.
- **Agricultural damage**: Flooding in agricultural areas has detrimental effects on crop productivity, leading to crop failures and food shortages. Many crops are unable to tolerate waterlogging and eventually perish.

### Long-terms impacts

- **Damage to infrastructure**: Flooding can cause significant damage to public infrastructure, including roads, rail networks, transport hubs, and shipping ports.
- **Decreased purchasing power and migration**: Damage to infrastructure can have long-term impacts on communities, leading to disruptions in clean water and electricity supply, transportation, communication, education, and healthcare. This can result in decreased purchasing power, loss of livelihoods, and reduced land value in flood-prone areas, increasing the vulnerability of affected communities. Prolonged economic impacts and suffering can trigger mass migration or population displacement.
- **Environmental damage**: Flooding can cause long-term damage to natural resources and ecosystems. Coastal flooding and erosion, exacerbated by climate change, can impact vulnerable coastal communities and natural habitats. Damage to coral reefs, for example, can increase future flood risk to people, property, and resources.
