    <h1 id="fire">Fire</h1>
    <p>Fire is a dangerous hazard caused by the process of burning. The term <em>fire</em> is used to describe a
      large-scale fire that causes serious damage to property, including houses and buildings. In addition, fire also
      poses a threat to the health and livelihoods of humans, animals, and vegetation.</p>
    <p>Fire safety is the set of practices intended to reduce damage caused by fire. Fire safety measures include those
      that are intended to prevent an uncontrolled fire from starting and those that are used to limit the spread and
      impact of a fire.</p>
    <p>Threats to fire safety are commonly referred to as <em>fire hazards</em>. A fire hazard may include a situation
      that increases the likelihood of a fire or may impede escape in the event a fire occurs.</p>

    <p>When a fire occurs, it will deplete oxygen and generate a significant amount of CO<sub>2</sub> gas. Additionally,
      fires create a fine dust carried by the wind, which can affect human health and environmental quality.</p>
    <p>Victims in fire accidents not only face the risk of lossing their lives, but they can also be at risk due to the
      lack of air.</p>

      To the environment

    </h3>
    <p>In addition, when incidents, risks, fires or explosions occur, chemicals will evaporate or spill, spread into
      into the environment, causing pollution and impacting the ecosystem, affecting lives and health of humans.</p>
    <p>The fastest spread of harmful chemicals is through the air. This is due to their nature of being in gas form or
      easily evaporated even at room temperature. Examples are chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>),
      mercury (Hg), digoxin (C<sub>41</sub>H<sub> 64</sub>O<sub>14</sub>), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), phosgene
      (COCl<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3 </sub>), especially substances used in the plant protection industry. They
      have the ability to cause quick and widespread harm to both humans and creatures, with high lethality.</p>
    <p>Another thing is that we have to use water to put out fire. However, the water will become polluted and flow to
      ponds, lakes, etc. This affects the biological ecology in the water and impacts the surrounding environment.</p>
    <p>The waste from the fire also affects the environment. Fire aftermath also vary depending on the object and the
      burning materials left behind.</p>

      <li>
        If the fire spreads:
        <ul>
          <li>Call for help/rescue</li>
          <li>Identify safe escape routes</li>
          <li>Cover one's nose with a damp towel while escaping</li>
          <li>Move in a low position to minimize smoke inhalation</li>

      <li>
        If there is a fire in a high-rise building:
        <ul>
          <li>Call for help/rescue</li>
          <li>Use damp blankets or other items to block smoke and gas from entering the room</li>
          <li>Proceed to the balcony and wait for rescuers</li>
          <li>Attract attention by shouting, using flashlights, or phone lights</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If the fire reaches one's body:
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid running around</li>
          <li>Lie down on one's stomach and roll back and forth</li>
