# Storm

A storm is a powerful and dangerous weather phenomenon characterised by strong winds and potential for serious environmental and human damage. Storms can take various forms, such as tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and cyclones, and can cause significant destruction to property and infrastructure.

## Categorisation

Storms can be classified into different types based on their characteristics and geographical regions. Here are some common types of storms:

- **Severe Thunderstorms:** Intense storms that produce severe weather conditions such as strong winds, heavy rain, lightning, and sometimes hail or tornadoes.
- **Tornadoes:** Powerful and destructive storms characterised by a rapidly rotating column of air in contact with the Earth's surface and a cumulonimbus cloud. They are often accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and hail.
- **Cyclones:** Large-scale tropical storms characterised by a low-pressure center and strong rotating winds. Also known as hurricanes or typhoons, they form over warm ocean waters and can cause widespread destruction due to high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. Cyclones are classified based on their wind speeds, ranging from categories 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
- **Dust Storms:** Storms that occur when strong winds lift and carry large amounts of dust or sand particles. Also known as sandstorms or haboobs.
- **Blizzards:** Severe winter storms characterised by strong winds, heavy snowfall, and reduced visibility. They typically occur in cold environments.
- **Tropical Storms:** Warm-based systems that derive their energy from warm ocean water and warm, moist air. They typically form in tropical regions and are characterised by strong winds and heavy rainfall. Tropical storms can develop into hurricanes or typhoons under certain conditions.
- **Squalls:** Sudden and intense bursts of wind associated with thunderstorms or frontal systems. They can produce strong gusts, heavy rain, and sometimes hail.
- **Extratropical Storms:** Storms that form outside of the tropics, usually at mid-latitudes, and are driven by temperature differences where two air masses meet and create a front. These storms can bring strong winds, heavy rain, and snowfall. They are common in regions like the northeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.
- **Supercell Thunderstorms:** Powerful and long-lasting storms characterised by a rotating updraft called a mesocyclone. They can produce severe weather conditions, including large hail, strong winds, heavy rain, and tornadoes.
- **Derechos:** Widespread, long-lived windstorms associated with a line of severe thunderstorms. They are characterised by straight-line winds that can cause significant damage over a large area. Derechos are often accompanied by heavy rain, lightning, and sometimes tornadoes.
- **Microbursts:** Localised columns of sinking air that can produce strong and damaging winds at the surface. They are often associated with thunderstorms.
- **Nor'easters:** Powerful extratropical storms that typically affect the northeastern coast of North America. They are characterised by strong winds, heavy precipitation, and coastal flooding.

## The formation

Storms, powerful natural phenomena, form over the sea due to a combination of factors. Studies reveal that they typically develop within a specific range of sea temperatures, specifically between 5°C to 20°C. High temperatures, around 26°C or higher, are also necessary for storm formation.

The energy needed for storm formation comes from the supply of uncooled water vapor, which is provided by the warm ocean surface. This water vapor serves as a crucial source of energy.

The rotation of the Earth, known as the Coriolis effect, plays a significant role in creating favorable conditions for storm formation. However, it's important to note that storms cannot form in the zone with temperatures ranging from 0 to 5 degrees. In this temperature range, the Coriolis effect and the two phases of the semicircle are generally too weak to generate the necessary vortices for storm formation.

For a storm to fully develop, the air within the vortex must reach specific dimensions. Typically, a storm forms when the vortex measures approximately 200 kilometers in width, extends about 1000 kilometers in length, and hovers around 10 to 12 kilometers above the sea surface.

## Impact

Storms can lead to various consequences, both to the people and the environment.

### Damage to humans

Storms can cause significant damage to humans, resulting in loss of life, injuries, and a range of public health issues. The strong winds, heavy rainfall, and tornadoes associated with storms can pose serious risks to individuals, causing injuries from minor cuts and bruises to more severe trauma, and in extreme cases, fatalities.

Furthermore, storms can have indirect effects on human well-being, disrupting essential infrastructure, leading to water and food shortages, and contributing to various public health problems. Floodwaters associated with storms can become contaminated with pollutants, sewage, and other hazardous substances, posing health risks to individuals who come into contact with them. Storms can also disrupt healthcare services, creating challenges in accessing essential medical care during and after the storm.

### Damage to the environment

Storms can significantly impact the environment, causing damage in various ways, such as flooding. Heavy rainfall from storms can lead to the overflow of rivers and lakes, inundating residential areas and posing threats to human lives and property. Floods can erode the land, alter the landscape, cause landslides, and destroy ecosystems and habitats, affecting plants and animals.

Moreover, storms can cause environmental pollution by overwhelming sewage systems, leading to the discharge of untreated wastewater into water bodies, contaminating rivers, lakes, and oceans, and posing health risks to humans and wildlife.

### Economic impact

Storms can cause significant material damage, including the destruction of buildings, houses, roads, bridges, and infrastructure. Strong winds can lead to collapsed walls and fallen trees, while heavy rain can cause flooding and erosion, damaging roads and bridges. Electrical systems and traffic infrastructure can also be affected. The economic impact of storm damage can be substantial, requiring costly repairs and rebuilding efforts.

In agricultural areas, storms and subsequent flooding can have devastating effects on crops, washing away topsoil and drowning or uprooting crops, resulting in significant economic losses for farmers and food shortages for communities.

## Measures to handle the situation

- **Stay informed:** Stay updated with information and warnings from government agencies, media, and reliable sources. Monitor weather forecasts and storm warnings to stay informed about storm conditions and developments.
- **Secure one's home:** Ensure the safety of one's home by reinforcing doors, windows, and roofs against strong winds. Use sturdy materials if necessary to protect doors and windows.
- **Follow evacuation orders:** If a government agency issues an evacuation order, comply and evacuate according to instructions, especially when living near the coast or in flood-prone areas.
- **Prepare essential supplies:** Stock up on essential items such as food, drinking water, flashlight, spare batteries, first aid supplies, and medication. Ensure to have enough supplies in case of emergency.
- **Avoid flood water:** Refrain from coming into contact with flood water, as it may contain contaminants and pose health risks.
- **Stay connected and supportive:** Keep in touch with family, friends, and neighbors to ensure everyone's safety. Offer support and assistance to those around when needed.
