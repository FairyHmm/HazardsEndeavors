    </h1>
    <p>A storm is a powerful and dangerous weather phenomenon characterised by strong winds and potential for serious
      environmental and human damage. Storms can take various forms, such as tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and
      cyclones, and can cause significant destruction to property and infrastructure.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Storms can be classified into different types based on their characteristics and geographical regions. Here are
      some common types of storms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Severe Thunderstorms:</strong> Intense storms that produce severe weather conditions such as strong
        winds, heavy rain, lightning, and sometimes hail or tornadoes.</li>
      <li><strong>Tornadoes:</strong> Powerful and destructive storms characterised by a rapidly rotating column of air
        in contact with the Earth's surface and a cumulonimbus cloud. They are often accompanied by strong winds,
        heavy rain, and hail.</li>
      <li><strong>Cyclones:</strong> Large-scale tropical storms characterised by a low-pressure center and strong
        rotating winds. Also known as hurricanes or typhoons, they form over warm ocean waters and can cause widespread
        destruction due to high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. Cyclones are classified based on their wind
        speeds, ranging from categories 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Dust Storms:</strong> Storms that occur when strong winds lift and carry large amounts of dust or sand
        particles. Also known as sandstorms or haboobs.</li>
      <li><strong>Blizzards:</strong> Severe winter storms characterised by strong winds, heavy snowfall, and reduced
        visibility. They typically occur in cold environments.</li>
      <li><strong>Tropical Storms:</strong> Warm-based systems that derive their energy from warm ocean water and warm,
        moist air. They typically form in tropical regions and are characterised by strong winds and heavy rainfall.
        Tropical storms can develop into hurricanes or typhoons under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Squalls:</strong> Sudden and intense bursts of wind associated with thunderstorms or frontal systems.
        They can produce strong gusts, heavy rain, and sometimes hail.</li>
      <li><strong>Extratropical Storms:</strong> Storms that form outside of the tropics, usually at mid-latitudes, and
        are driven by temperature differences where two air masses meet and create a front. These storms can bring
        strong winds, heavy rain, and snowfall. They are common in regions like the northeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Supercell Thunderstorms:</strong> Powerful and long-lasting storms characterised by a rotating updraft
        called a mesocyclone. They can produce severe weather conditions, including large hail, strong winds, heavy
        rain, and tornadoes.</li>
      <li><strong>Derechos:</strong> Widespread, long-lived windstorms associated with a line of severe thunderstorms.
        They are characterised by straight-line winds that can cause significant damage over a large area. Derechos are
        often accompanied by heavy rain, lightning, and sometimes tornadoes.</li>
      <li><strong>Microbursts:</strong> Localised columns of sinking air that can produce strong and damaging winds at
        the surface. They are often associated with thunderstorms.</li>
      <li><strong>Nor'easters:</strong> Powerful extratropical storms that typically affect the northeastern coast
        of North America. They are characterised by strong winds, heavy precipitation, and coastal flooding.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-formation" class="anchor">
      The formation
      <a href="#the-formation" class="hash">#</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Storms, powerful natural phenomena, form over the sea due to a combination of factors. Studies reveal that they
      typically develop within a specific range of sea temperatures, specifically between 5°C to 20°C. High
      temperatures, around 26°C or higher, are also necessary for storm formation.</p>
    <p>The energy needed for storm formation comes from the supply of uncooled water vapor, which is provided by the
      warm ocean surface. This water vapor serves as a crucial source of energy.</p>
    <p>The rotation of the Earth, known as the Coriolis effect, plays a significant role in creating favorable
      conditions for storm formation. However, it's important to note that storms cannot form in the zone with
      temperatures ranging from 0 to 5 degrees. In this temperature range, the Coriolis effect and the two phases of the
      semicircle are generally too weak to generate the necessary vortices for storm formation.</p>
    <p>For a storm to fully develop, the air within the vortex must reach specific dimensions. Typically, a storm forms
      when the vortex measures approximately 200 kilometers in width, extends about 1000 kilometers in length, and
      hovers around 10 to 12 kilometers above the sea surface.</p>

      Impact
      <a href="#impact" class="hash">#</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Storms can lead to various consequences, both to the people and the environment.</p>
    <h3 id="damage-to-humans" class="anchor">
      Damage to humans
      <a href="#damage-to-humans" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Storms can cause significant damage to humans, resulting in loss of life, injuries, and a range of public health
      issues. The strong winds, heavy rainfall, and tornadoes associated with storms can pose serious risks to
      individuals, causing injuries from minor cuts and bruises to more severe trauma, and in extreme cases, fatalities.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, storms can have indirect effects on human well-being, disrupting essential infrastructure, leading
      to water and food shortages, and contributing to various public health problems. Floodwaters associated with
      storms can become contaminated with pollutants, sewage, and other hazardous substances, posing health risks to
      individuals who come into contact with them. Storms can also disrupt healthcare services, creating challenges in
      accessing essential medical care during and after the storm.</p>
    <h3 id="damage-to-the-environment" class="anchor">
      Damage to the environment
      <a href="#damage-to-the-environment" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Storms can significantly impact the environment, causing damage in various ways, such as flooding. Heavy rainfall
      from storms can lead to the overflow of rivers and lakes, inundating residential areas and posing threats to human
      lives and property. Floods can erode the land, alter the landscape, cause landslides, and destroy ecosystems and
      habitats, affecting plants and animals.</p>
    <p>Moreover, storms can cause environmental pollution by overwhelming sewage systems, leading to the discharge of
      untreated wastewater into water bodies, contaminating rivers, lakes, and oceans, and posing health risks to humans
      and wildlife.</p>
    <h3 id="economic-impact" class="anchor">
      Economic impact
      <a href="#economic-impact" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Storms can cause significant material damage, including the destruction of buildings, houses, roads, bridges, and
      infrastructure. Strong winds can lead to collapsed walls and fallen trees, while heavy rain can cause flooding and
      erosion, damaging roads and bridges. Electrical systems and traffic infrastructure can also be affected. The
      economic impact of storm damage can be substantial, requiring costly repairs and rebuilding efforts.</p>
    <p>In agricultural areas, storms and subsequent flooding can have devastating effects on crops, washing away topsoil
      and drowning or uprooting crops, resulting in significant economic losses for farmers and food shortages for
      communities.</p>
