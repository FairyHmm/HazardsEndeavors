    <h1>Wildfire</h1>
    <p>A wildfire, also known as a forest fire, is a fire event that occurs in a forest, affecting or destroying some or
      all components of that forest. Wildfires can be controlled fires in silviculture or uncontrolled fires.</p>

      Human causes
      <a href="#human-causes" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Most wildfires are caused by human activities.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Uncontrolled fire:</strong> Uncontrolled fires can be caused by human error, such as not paying
        attention or failing to take proper fire prevention measures. Additionally, the presence of flammable and
        combustible materials, including liquids and gases, can contribute to the occurrence and spread of fires.
        Improper usage or maintenance of electrical equipment can also ignite fires.</li>
      <li><strong>Burning forests:</strong> Burning forests for land can lead to the spread of wildfires, which can
        cause significant damage to land, structures, and the environment. When forests are burned before planting trees
        or creating turf, it may alter the ecosystem, increase fire risk, and lead to poor air quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Careless behaviors:</strong> Careless behavior in forest areas, such as throwing away cigarettes,
        lighting campfires, or using spark-causing tools, can lead to the ignition of wildfires.</li>
      <li><strong>Arson:</strong> Deliberately setting fires in forests is a criminal act that can cause extensive
        damage to the environment and put lives at risk. Arson can be motivated by various reasons, including vandalism,
        revenge, or even for personal amusement.</li>
      <li><strong>Equipment and machinery use:</strong> The use of equipment and machinery in or near forested areas can
        lead to accidental fires. Examples include operating chainsaws, lawnmowers, or agricultural machinery without
        proper precautions, which can generate sparks or ignite flammable materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Negligence during recreational activities:</strong> Activities such as camping, picnicking, and
        barbecuing in forested areas can pose fire risks if not conducted responsibly. Failing to properly extinguish
        campfires or dispose of hot ashes can easily lead to wildfires.</li>
      <li><strong>Power line accidents:</strong> Electrical power lines passing through or near forested areas can
        sometimes cause fires due to equipment failure, fallen branches, or arcing. These accidents can be exacerbated
        during dry and windy conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Illegal activities:</strong> Illegal activities like drug cultivation, logging, or mining in forested
        areas can also lead to wildfires. These activities often involve the use of fire to clear land or conceal
        evidence, which can quickly escalate into uncontrolled wildfires.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="natural-causes" class="anchor">
      Natural causes
      <a href="#natural-causes" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Wildfires can be caused by a combination of natural factors.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Temperature and climate:</strong> High temperatures, dry climate, and strong winds can create
        favorable conditions for wildfires to spread. Research shows that changes in climate create warmer, drier
        conditions, which increase the risk of wildfires.</li>
      <li><strong>Drought:</strong> Drought conditions can increase the risk of wildfires by drying out vegetation and
        making it more susceptible to ignition. Droughts can affect the amount and dryness of fuel, such as trees and
        grass, which can contribute to the spread of wildfires.</li>
      <li><strong>Lightning strikes:</strong> When lightning strikes a dry area, particularly one with dry vegetation,
        it can create an intense heat source that has the power to start a fire. The electrical discharge from the
        lightning bolt can ignite any flammable material it encounters, such as dried leaves, grass, or trees.</li>
      <li><strong>Volcanic activities:</strong> Volcanic eruptions can release large amounts of heat, ash, and gases
        into the atmosphere, which can ignite wildfires. The intense heat and ash can ignite vegetation, leading to the
        spread of wildfires.</li>
      <li><strong>Spontaneous combustions:</strong> Under certain conditions, organic materials such as decomposing
        leaves, peat, or manure can generate heat and eventually ignite, leading to wildfires.</li>
    </ul>

      Impacts
      <a href="#impacts" class="hash">#</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Wildfires have a wide range of impacts on the environment, human life, and the economy.</p>
    <h3 id="danger-to-human-life-and-property" class="anchor">
      Danger to human life and property
      <a href="#danger-to-human-life-and-property" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>One of the most immediate and visible impacts of wildfires is the danger they pose to human life and property.
      Wildfires can spread rapidly, engulfing homes, infrastructure, and natural landscapes in their path. The
      destruction caused by wildfires can lead to the displacement of communities and the loss of homes, businesses, and
      livelihoods. In extreme cases, wildfires can result in the loss of human lives and necessitate emergency
      evacuations to ensure the safety of individuals in affected areas.</p>
    <h3 id="environmental-damage" class="anchor">
      Environmental damage
      <a href="#environmental-damage" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>The combustion of vegetation releases large amounts of smoke, ash, and other pollutants into the atmosphere,
      leading to air pollution. These pollutants can have detrimental effects on air quality and human health,
      particularly for individuals with respiratory conditions. The ash and debris from wildfires can also contaminate
      water bodies, affecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, the heat from wildfires can cause soil
      erosion and degradation, impacting soil fertility and the ability of the land to support plant growth.</p>
    <p>Wildfires result in the destruction of valuable resources such as trees, plants, animals, and bacteria. The
      intense heat and flames of a wildfire can quickly consume vegetation, leading to the loss of habitat for many
      species. This loss of biodiversity can have long-term consequences for ecosystems and disrupt the delicate balance
      of nature.</p>
    <h3 id="loss-of-landscape-and-economic-value" class="anchor">
      Loss of landscape and economic value
      <a href="#loss-of-landscape-and-economic-value" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Wildfires can have significant impacts on the landscape and economic value of an area. The destruction of natural
      landscapes and iconic landmarks due to wildfires can result in the loss of their aesthetic and recreational value.
      This can have a negative impact on tourism, which often relies on the natural beauty of an area. In addition,
      wildfires can damage agricultural lands, leading to crop loss and impacting the livelihoods of farmers and
      agricultural communities. The economic consequences of wildfires can be far-reaching, affecting local economies
      and businesses that depend on the affected areas.</p>
    <h3 id="long-term-impacts" class="anchor">
      Long-term impacts
      <a href="#long-term-impacts" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>The aftermath of wildfires can have long-lasting effects on the environment and communities. Restoring the
      environment and regenerating the ecosystem after a wildfire requires significant time, resources, and careful
      management. This process involves activities such as replanting vegetation, managing soil erosion, and supporting
      the return of wildlife. The long-term impact of wildfires can also extend to the mental and emotional well-being
      of individuals and communities affected by the devastation and loss caused by these natural disasters.</p>
    <h2 id="preventive-measures-">Preventive measures:</h2>
    <h3 id="limit-forest-burning" class="anchor">
      Limit forest burning
      <a href="#limit-forest-burning" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>To prevent wildfires, it is crucial to avoid uncontrolled forest burning and comply with fire prevention
      regulations. This includes refraining from activities such as unauthorised burning of vegetation or debris.</p>

      Forest care and sanitation
      <a href="#forest-care-and-sanitation" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Implementing forest care and sanitation measures is essential to reduce the risk of wildfires. This involves
      removing flammable materials and maintaining the cleanliness of forest areas. Measures may include trimming trees,
      clearing forests of dead vegetation, and removing flammable materials from the ground. These actions help minimise
      the availability of fuel for fires and reduce the likelihood of fire spread.</p>
    <h3 id="build-fire-runways" class="anchor">
      Build fire runways
      <a href="#build-fire-runways" class="hash">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Creating fire runways around forest areas can help prevent the spread of wildfires. Fire runways are designated
      areas without vegetation or with less flammable vegetation. These areas act as barriers, hindering the progress of
      fires and providing a safer zone for firefighting efforts.</p>
    <h3 id="monitoring-and-early-detection" class="anchor">
      Monitoring and early detection
      <a href="#monitoring-and-early-detection" class="hash">#</a>
