# Flood

A flood is a natural occurrence where a large amount of water accumulates and spreads across a vast area of land. This can happen due to factors like heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or the overflow of rivers and lakes. When the water surpasses the land's capacity to absorb or drain it, it starts to submerge the land, resulting in a flood.

## Causes

### High tide and low tide

High tide is when the sea level rises, potentially causing flooding in coastal and low areas. On the other hand, low tide is when the water level drops suddenly, revealing normally submerged areas that can become more susceptible to flooding during future high tide occurrences.

### Heavy rainfall

Heavy rain can occur due to intense thunderstorms, tropical cyclones, or prolonged precipitation. When a significant amount of rain falls in a short time or continues for an extended period, the ground becomes saturated and unable to absorb more water. This results in rapid runoff into rivers, lakes, and streams, causing water levels to rise quickly. If these water bodies exceed their capacity, they can overflow and cause flooding in nearby areas.

### Effects of storms

Storms like hurricanes, typhoons, or tropical storms can bring heavy rain and strong winds. When these storms reach land, the combination of rainfall and winds can result in storm surges, where large amounts of water are pushed towards coastal regions. This can lead to flooding along the coasts. Furthermore, the strong winds associated with storms can cause damage to infrastructure, disrupt drainage systems, and increase the likelihood of flooding.

### Dam failure

Dams are structures designed to store and regulate the flow of water. However, if a dam is poorly maintained or cannot withstand the pressure of a large volume of water, it may fail. Dam failures can occur due to factors such as structural weaknesses, inadequate maintenance, or extreme weather events. When a dam fails, it can result in the sudden release of a significant amount of water, leading to flash floods downstream.

### Snowmelt

Flooding caused by snowmelt occurs when accumulated snow rapidly melts, often due to a sudden rise in temperature or heavy rainfall. As the snow melts, it can overwhelm the natural drainage systems and lead to an excess of water, resulting in flooding.

### Geographical factors

Some geographical characteristics can increase an area's susceptibility to flooding. Low areas, such as floodplains or coastal plains, are naturally closer to water bodies and more prone to flooding. Moreover, areas with inadequate water management infrastructure, such as insufficient or poorly maintained drainage systems, face a higher risk of flooding as water cannot be effectively diverted.

### Climate change

Climate change is causing shifts in weather patterns and an increase in extreme weather events. Rising global temperatures lead to more evaporation and moisture in the atmosphere, resulting in heavier rainfall during storms. Climate change also contributes to rising sea levels as glaciers and ice caps melt. These changes amplify the frequency and intensity of flooding events, especially in coastal regions.

## Impact

### Human impacts

Flooding poses significant risks to human lives. The rapid rise of floodwaters can make evacuation challenging, leading to fatalities and injuries. The contamination of floodwater with sewage, chemicals, and other hazardous substances can result in the spread of waterborne diseases and infections. Limited access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and proper hygiene conditions can further worsen health risks, especially for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.

Flooding can also cause psychological distress as people face trauma from the loss of homes, belongings, and disruption to their daily lives. Displacement and separation from family and community can further intensify the emotional toll.

### Environmental impact

Floodwaters frequently carry sediment, debris, and pollutants from industrial areas, agricultural fields, and urban runoff. As the floodwaters recede, these contaminants can be deposited on land and in water bodies, resulting in water and soil pollution. This pollution can have harmful consequences for freshwater and marine ecosystems, including the loss of biodiversity, damage to aquatic organisms, and disturbances to ecosystem balance. Moreover, the accumulation of pollutants in soil can affect agricultural productivity and pose long-term risks to human health.

### Infrastructure damage

Flooding can cause significant harm to infrastructure, including residential and commercial buildings, transportation systems, and public facilities. The force of floodwaters can erode and weaken structures, resulting in collapses and extensive damage. Roads and bridges may be washed away or become unsafe, disrupting transportation and access to vital services. Furthermore, flooding can harm electrical systems, water supply networks, and communication infrastructure, worsening the impact on affected communities.

### Economic impact

Flooding can have significant economic consequences. The damage caused to infrastructure, such as homes, businesses, and public facilities, can result in substantial financial losses. Disruptions to production, agriculture, and services can lead to reduced economic output and productivity. Businesses may have to suspend operations or face challenges in accessing resources and markets. Furthermore, the displacement of workers and the loss of jobs can have long-term impacts on individuals and communities, affecting livelihoods and income stability. The costs of post-flood recovery and rebuilding efforts can impose a significant burden on local and national economies.

## Measures to handle the situation

### Ensuring personal safety

During a flood, it is vital to prioritise the safety of one's self and one's family. Assess the situation and perceive any immediate danger, such as rising water levels or structural damage, and move to a higher, safe location. This could be the upper floors of a house, a neighboring building, or a designated evacuation center. Keep away from windows, electrical appliances, and other potential hazards. It is crucial to follow the instructions and guidance of local authorities regarding evacuation orders.

### Follow warnings and instructions

Stay informed about the flood situation by regularly checking reliable sources, such as government agencies, local news channels, and official social media accounts. Pay close attention to any warnings, alerts, or instructions provided by these sources. They may provide essential information on evacuation routes, safe areas, and emergency contact numbers. Following these instructions is vital in minimising the risks associated with flooding.

### Ensure clean water usage

In times of flooding, the regular water supply may become contaminated. It is crucial to ensure that the water to consume and use for daily activities is clean and safe. When uncertain about the safety of the water supply, use bottled water or boil tap water before drinking or cooking.

Refrain from using or consuming water from sources directly impacted by the flood. Floodwater can be contaminated with pollutants like sewage, chemicals, and debris, posing health risks such as waterborne diseases, infections, and injuries. Therefore, it is crucial to minimise direct contact with floodwater. If contact is unavoidable, wear protective clothing, such as rubber boots and gloves. After any contact with floodwater, wash hands thoroughly with soap and clean water.

### Seek assistance from charitable organisations

If requiring assistance during a flood, contact local charitable organisations or government agencies responsible for disaster management. These organisations are trained and equipped to provide support during such situations. They can offer emergency supplies, temporary shelter, medical aid, and other necessary resources. Ensure to have emergency contact numbers readily available and communicate one's needs to the appropriate authorities.
